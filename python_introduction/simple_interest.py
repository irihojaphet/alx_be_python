# Simple Interest Calculator
# Formula: I = P * R * T

# Define the variables
principal = 1000    # Principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05        # Annual interest rate (5% as decimal)
time = 3           # Time in years

# Calculate simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result in the required format
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
